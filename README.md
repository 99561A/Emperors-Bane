Emperor's Bane was team Ambush's robot during the 2018-2019 VRC game, Turning Point.
It made it to VRC Worlds 2019, where at one point it placed #1 in the middle school division.
It accomplished this using a skilled driver and 11 separate autonomous programs that can be used anywhere on the field.

# Subsystems
- #### Drivetrain/Chassis
The chassis was entirely made of steel to make the center of mass lower. This way, the bot wouldn't tip as easy. 4 motors were used here.
- #### Lift arm
The arm used one motor to be able to flip a cap. It had small wheels attached to the bottom that would prevent it from dragging on the mats and potentially getting stuck.
- #### Ball punchers
There were two 'punchers' on the sides of the bot. They used a high strength motor to pull back a linear motion slider, which was spring loaded with rubber bands. The motor would rotate until the linear slider touched a limit switch, which disabled the motor. This would make the slider "loaded" and ready to fire. When a ball was loaded, the motor could be told to spin a slight amount, which released the slider and it shot the ball out using many rubber bands. The gear used to move the slider had one side shaved off so it would be able to release.
- #### The Swiffer
"Swiffer" was a joke made by one of the team members that eventually stuck and even made its way into the code. There were two arms that had 3 positions, which would be determined by potentiometers. On the ends of the arms were two rubber bands that could be pushed down onto a ball, which would allow the ball to be loaded into the launchers or kept as a preload.
